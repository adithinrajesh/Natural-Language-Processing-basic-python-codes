# Natural-Language-Processing-basic-python-codes
Python codes of basic NLP tasks.
The following codes are included:
1. Performing Tokenization, stop word removal, determining synsets - hyponyms - hypernyms, lemmatisation, stemming, named entity recognition, and finding the ambiguity in a sentence using parse tree - Using NLTK Package
2. Performing T-test to determine if the sequence of words form a collocation or not. The file webtext.txt contains a small corpus that is used in this test.
3. Performing Chi-Square test to determine if the sequence of words form a collocation or not. The file webtext.txt contains a small corpus that is used in this test.
4. Implementing the decision rule-based Na√Øve Bayes disambiguation method to find the sense of an ambiguous word with the given training set.
5. Implementing the Hindle and Rooth algorithm for solving the attachment ambiguity problem.
