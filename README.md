# Natural-Language-Processing-basic-python-codes
Python codes of basic NLP tasks.
The following codes are included:
1. Performing Tokenization, stop word removal, determining synsets - hyponyms - hypernyms, lemmatisation, stemming, named entity recognition, and finding the ambiguity in a sentence using parse tree - Using NLTK Package
2. Performing T-test to determine if the sequence of words form a collocation or not. The file webtext.txt contains a small corpus that is used in this test.
3. Performing Chi-Square test to determine if the sequence of words form a collocation or not. The file webtext.txt contains a small corpus that is used in this test.
4. Implementing the decision rule-based Na√Øve Bayes disambiguation method to find the sense of an ambiguous word with the given training set.
5. Implementing the Hindle and Rooth algorithm for solving the attachment ambiguity problem. The file corp.txt contains a small corpus that is used in this test.
6. Implementing the forward and backward procedures using Hidden Markov Model to find the probability of a word sequence.
7. Implementing the Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) and find the inside probability of a word sequence using the CYK algorithm.
